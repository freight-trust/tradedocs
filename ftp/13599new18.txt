licensed by OFAC to transact business with U.S. persons in
anticipation of removal from the list or because of foreign policy
considerations in unique circumstances.  Licensing in anticipation
of official Federal Register publication of a notice of removal
based on the unblocking of an entity's or individual's property is
reflected in this publication and by removal from the 13599 List.
