This publication of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control
("OFAC") is designed as a reference tool providing actual notice of
actions by OFAC with respect to persons that are identified as
members of the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) who were
elected on the party slate of a Foreign Terrorist Organization
(FTO), Specially Designated Terrorist (SDT), or Specially
Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT).  The latest changes may appear
here prior to their publication in the Federal Register, and it is
intended that users rely on changes indicated in this document that
post-date the most recent Federal Register publication. Such
changes reflect official actions of OFAC, and will be reflected as
soon as practicable in the Federal Register under the index heading

to the PLC List may be published at any time. Users are advised to
check the Federal Register and this electronic publication
