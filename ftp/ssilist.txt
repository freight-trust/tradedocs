The Sectoral Sanctions Identifications List (the "SSI List") 

This publication of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control
("OFAC") is a reference tool providing actual notice of actions by
OFAC with respect to persons that are identified pursuant to
Executive Order 13662. The latest changes may appear here prior to
their publication in the Federal Register, and it is intended that
users rely on changes indicated in this document.  Such changes
reflect official actions of OFAC, and will be reflected as soon as
practicable in the Federal Register under the index heading
"Foreign Assets Control."  New Federal Register notices with regard
to identifications made under Executive Order 13662 may be
published at any time.  Users are advised to check the Federal
Register and this electronic publication routinely for additional
names or other changes to the listings. Entities and individuals on
the list are occasionally licensed by OFAC to transact business
with U.S. persons in anticipation of removal from the list or
because of foreign policy considerations in unique circumstances. 
Licensing in anticipation of official Federal Register publication
of a notice of removal based on the unblocking of an entity's or
individual's property is reflected in this publication by the
removal of an identified name from the list.

Description of the SSI List:

This Sectoral Sanctions Identifications List includes persons
determined by OFAC to be operating in sectors of the Russian
economy identified by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to
Executive Order 13662. The prohibitions on dealings related to the
persons identified on this list are described in the directives
below. Persons identified pursuant to each directive will appear
under the corresponding directive on the SSI List.   

The property and interests in property of persons identified on the
SSI List are not blocked, but persons sanctioned under E.O. 13662
and on the SSI List may also be persons whose property and
interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O 13662 or pursuant
to other authorities administered by OFAC. Persons on the SSI List
whose property and interests in property are blocked under E.O
13662 or other authorities will appear on OFAC's SDN list with
program tags for relevant blocking authorities.
