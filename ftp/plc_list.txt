This publication of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control
("OFAC") is a reference tool providing actual notice of actions by
OFAC with respect to persons that are identified as members of the
Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) who were elected on the party
slate of a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO), Specially
Designated Terrorist (SDT), or Specially Designated Global
Terrorist (SDGT).

The latest changes may appear here prior to their publication in
the Federal Register, and it is intended that users rely on changes
indicated in this document.  Such changes reflect official actions
of OFAC, and will be reflected as soon as practicable in the
Federal Register under the index heading "Foreign Assets Control." 
New Federal Register notices with regard
to identifications made may be published at any time.  Users are
advised to check the Federal Register and this electronic
publication routinely for additional names or other changes to the
listings. 

The PLC List is not part of the Specially Designated Nationals and
Blocked Persons (SDN) List.  United States financial institutions
must reject transactions involving these individuals on the PLC
List, provided that any such individuals are not also named on
OFAC's SDN List. OFAC has created the program code [NS-PLC] for
these individuals. The prefix "NS" stands for "non-SDN".

Persons on the PLC List whose property and interests in property
are blocked will also appear on OFAC's SDN list with program tags
for relevant blocking authorities.
