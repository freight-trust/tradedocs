List of Persons Identified as Blocked Solely Pursuant to Executive
Order 13599 (E.O. 13599 List).  

To assist the public in complying with the Iranian Transactions and
Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 560 (the "ITSR"), the
following is a list of persons identified by OFAC as meeting the
definition of the term Government of Iran or the term Iranian
financial institution as set forth in, respectively, sections
560.304 and 560.324 of the ITSR.  Pursuant to Executive Order
13599, as implemented through section 560.211 of the ITSR, the
property and interests in property of persons included on this
list, as well as property such as vessels identified on this list,
must be blocked if they are in or come within the United States or
if they are in or come within the possession or control of a U.S.
person, wherever located.  This list does not include persons whose
property and interests in property are blocked under both Part 560
and one or more other parts of 31 C.F.R. chapter V.  Such persons
are included on OFAC's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked
Persons List (SDN List) with the identifier "[IRAN]" as well as the
relevant identifier(s) for the other sanctions program(s) pursuant
to which the persons' property and interests in property are
blocked.  

Pursuant to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action of July 14, 2015
(JCPOA), the United States committed to lift secondary sanctions
with respect to activity with certain persons, including the
individuals and entities on the E.O. 13599 List, on Implementation
Day.  Effective as of Implementation Day, non-U.S. persons will not
be subject to secondary sanctions solely for engaging in activity
that involves persons included on the E.O. 13599 List, provided
that the activity does not involve persons on the SDN List or
conduct that remains sanctionable as described in Section VII of
the Guidance Relating to the Lifting of Certain Sanctions Pursuant
to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on Implementation Day
(the "Guidance Document") [https://www.treasury.gov/resource-
center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/implement_guide_jcpoa.pdf]. 
For more information on the JCPOA, see the Guidance Document and
related Frequently Asked Questions
[https://www.treasury.gov/resource-
center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/jcpoa_faqs.pdf].

Note that, unless an exemption from regulation or express OFAC
authorization applies, the ITSR prohibit U.S. persons from engaging
in most transactions with persons meeting the definition of
Government of Iran or Iranian financial institutions, regardless of
whether such persons are located or incorporated inside or outside
of Iran or whether such persons have been identified by OFAC and
included on the E.O. 13599 List or the SDN List with the identifier
"[IRAN]."

The latest changes to the E.O. 13599 List may appear here prior to
their publication in the Federal Register.  Such changes reflect
official actions of OFAC, and will be published as soon as
practicable in the Federal Register under the index heading
"Foreign Assets Control."
