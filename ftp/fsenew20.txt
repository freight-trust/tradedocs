This publication of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control
("OFAC") is designed as a reference tool providing actual notice of
actions by OFAC with respect to the List of Foreign Sanctions
Evaders (the "FSE List"),   to assist the public in complying with
the various sanctions programs administered by OFAC. The latest
changes may appear here prior to their publication in the Federal
Register, and it is intended that users rely on changes indicated
in this document that post-date the most recent Federal Register
publication. Such changes reflect official actions of OFAC, and 
will be reflected as soon as practicable in the Federal Register
under the index heading  "Foreign Assets Control."  New Federal
Register notices with regard to the FSE List may be published at
any time.  Users are advised to check the Federal Register and this
electronic publication routinely for additional names or other
changes to the listings. The following changes have occurred with
respect to the Office of Foreign Assets Control FSE List since
