### Advanced Sanctions Data Model XML

REFERENCE VALUE SETS contain the reference or “look-up” data used throughout the XML file. For example, the REFERENCE VALUE SETS section of the XML contains a list of countries with a corresponding ID (See Figure 3). When the data file needs to reference a country, it refers back to that country’s unique ID number as defined in REFERENCE VALUE SETS. Where available, ISO codes and other industry standard values are used, such as ISO 3166 country codes.
